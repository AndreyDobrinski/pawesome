Chloe is working on stepping up and target training in her foster home and doesn't seem to mind being around other birds and dogs. Chloe is fully flighted and needs an owner who understands bird body language and can keep an eye out for potential nips.",

Harper is roughly 3 years old and came from a home where he was harassed by a cat and pecked at by another bird. He built up a tough guy exterior, but loves to sing to other birds and his foster mom. Harper is very afraid of hands and has been learning to step up on a perch. He can be aggressive when approached and doesn't like when his foster brother JJ stands too close (a cage with room for personal space is a must). Despite this, he and his brother have begun preening each other and there is affection there. With the right home, these two will be great companions for a home that appreciates them without needing to hold them all the time.",

      "description": "Pancho is a male, 19 year old yellow-naped Amazon who truly enjoys hanging out with people. A true talker, Pancho will wow you with his vocabulary of, “Hey boy, aloha, and oh boy!” Pancho is a hearty and healthy eater who enjoys his share of sugar snap peas, apples, bell peppers, pistachios and corn. He’s great at destroying his toys, has a fascination with bells and loves to get baths on sunny days! Although he doesn’t do well with children, Pancho may be okay with other parrots and pets in the household.",

      "description": "Charlie makes kissy noises and loves pomegranate seeds! He can get overstimulated, so may do best in a calm environment, but where he can observe any activity going on in the home. Like all Quakers, he is very protective of his cage, so it is best to interact with him outside of it, and service the cage when he is not inside it. He would do best in a behavior-savvy home that will let him set the pace, respect his body language and walk away when applicable, and just appreciate him for the funny little guy that he is, and treasure every small milestone of his trust that is earned!",
