He walks well on leash and does well with potty training but is still a baby so an occasional accident may happen from time to time. He is good with other dogs and happily meets other dogs. A home without small children is best due to his breed and herding instincts. He always seems to be smiling and doing okay on leash training. Toby is already fully vetted and ready for his new home.",

He jumps up on people out of excitement, Teens great dog manners will be best due to Yolo's size and jumping. This good boy loves to play with other big dogs, but can overwhelm a small dog and he has not lived with cats, so no cats or small dogs. Yolo was living a sad life until his rescuers saved him and taught him love, paddle boarding, napping and the good life.

With all of that, what else can I say about Booker? He loves his people! Booker would do perfectly with someone who works from home. He is currently in a foster home with two huskies and he is absolutely dog-friendly. Booker would do best in a home where he has a canine friend, preferably a confident female. Booker is a low energy lab, but he does get excited when he knows we are going for a walk or a ride in the car, but he is easily calmed. He knows his basic commands too! He is 99.9% PERFECT!",

We don't always know what a cat's life was like before they were brought to the shelter. They may have had difficult or limited experiences with people. Whatever the reason, some cats are fearful and in need of a special family.",

Harper is very afraid of hands and has been learning to step up on a perch. He can be aggressive when approached and doesn't like when his foster brother JJ stands too close (a cage with room for personal space is a must). Despite this, he and his brother have begun preening each other and there is affection there.
