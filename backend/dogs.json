He is housebroken, and would love a new family. At the time, Lenny is heartworm positive, but will have his treatment provided by us and will be healthy again! Your new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.",

      "description": "Yolo is an energetic and cuddly, athletic and happy dog that enjoys paddle boarding and swimming, running around and any other forms of activity. He is a great nap partner and activity partner alike. Yolo likes riding in the car, but not so much getting shots. Yolo is very strong. He needs training to walk nicely on leash. He jumps up on people out of excitement, Teens great dog manners will be best due to Yolo's size and jumping. This good boy loves to play with other big dogs, but can overwhelm a small dog and he has not lived with cats, so no cats or small dogs. Yolo was living a sad life until his rescuers saved him and taught him love, paddle boarding, napping and the good life. Because they live in a studio with no yard, they want to find a great home in which Yolo has plenty of room to run as well as people to love, protect and show him fun forever.",

      "description": "Booker is crate trained, house broken, has house manners, sleeps through the night, enjoys his walks and rides perfectly in the car! With all of that, what else can I say about Booker? He loves his people! Booker would do perfectly with someone who works from home. He is currently in a foster home with two huskies and he is absolutely dog-friendly. Booker would do best in a home where he has a canine friend, preferably a confident female. Booker is a low energy lab, but he does get excited when he knows we are going for a walk or a ride in the car, but he is easily calmed. He knows his basic commands too! He is 99.9% PERFECT!",
